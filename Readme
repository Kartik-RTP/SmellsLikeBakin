The concepts / Features of android tested out here

1)Fragments
2)Adding those fragments dynamically by using a viewgroup as a placeholder
3)Using a RecyclerView (remember to add dependency statement) and LinearLayoutManager for it to act as a list
4)Making a custom adabter for RecyclerView
5)Brief overview of Fragment lifecycle ---can be used for later understanding it.
6)Glimpse of viewPager and FragmentPagerAdapter
7)Fixing back button issues with fragments - using Regular fragments with "Activity " class (but losing the default Action Bar in this case) and "Support-v4" fragments with "AppCombatActvity" instead of overriding the "OnBackPressed" function.
8)Added TabLayout from Design Support Library and set it up with Fragment Pager Adapter for easy navigation among Fragments
